		<ul>
			<h3> <li>The Best Mates dance - with its weird swinging arms and high knees - was invented by Marlon Webb on his Vine channel! Since then it's been copied by thousands of people, so it makes sense it would be included in a game as popular as Fortnite.</li> 
			<li>  The first dance most people ever saw in Battle Royale, this dance was taken from the comedy show 'Scrubs', which was about a group of doctors learning how to save lives. The character Turk did this dance in one episode, and Epic Games decided to pay tribute! </li> 
			<li> This dance was originally a street dance done to electro music. It got really popular in Paris and then when some YouTubers decided to show it off. Now it's all over the place - even in Overwatch!</li>
