		<h4><p> <h7> <b> <a href = "https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/home"> Fortnite  </a> </b> is an online video game first released in 2017 and developed by Epic Games. 
					It is available as separate software packages having different game modes that otherwise share the same general gameplay and game engine. 
					The game modes include Fortnite: Save the World, a cooperative shooter-survival game for up to four players to fight off zombie-like creatures and defend objects with fortifications they can build, and Fortnite Battle Royale, a free-to-play battle royale game where up to 100 players fight to be the last person standing. 
					Both game modes were released in 2017 as early access titles; Save the World is available only for Microsoft Windows, macOS, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, while Battle Royale has been released for those platforms in addition for Nintendo Switch, iOS and Android devices. </h7> </p>
